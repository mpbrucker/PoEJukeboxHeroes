Within our jukebox, there are three mechanical subsystems: the enclosure, the marble chutes, and the marble return. The enclosure looks like a jukebox, and integrates all mechanical and electrical subsystems. The marble chutes allow the solenoids to accurately drop one marble at a time onto the corresponding xylophone note below. The marble return carries the marbles from the bottom of the enclosure to the top.  

## Enclosure Subsystem  

The jukebox enclosure has an upper component and a lower component within the side walls. All parts of the enclosure were laser cut out of plywood and glued together with wood glue. The upper component consists of a ramp that slopes down towards the xylophone in order to funnel all of the marbles into the marble chutes to be dropped by the solenoids. On top of this ramp, there are guiding ridges and bumpers to channel the marbles into the holes that let the marbles fall through into the chutes. The marble chutes and solenoids are mounted to the bottom of this ramp. The lower component consists of a ramp that slopes away from the xylophone in order to funnel the marbles back towards the marble return system. On this ramp, there is a layer of foam to dampen the sound of the marbles landing onto the plywood. The foam was covered in black fabric to make it a more aesthetically pleasing color than bright green. We also added strips of black electrical tape on top of the fabric to decrease the friction between the marbles and the foam so that they would successfully roll down to the return system. There are also angled ridges that the xylophone rests on so that the marbles bounce away from the xylophone towards the return system. To prevent the marbles from bouncing past the return system, there are two tall ridges covered in foam that slant towards the return system.  

## Marble Release Mechanism  

The task of releasing one marble at a time was not a trivial one. Almost everyone in the group had a turn with it, and the system went through about 20 redesigns before a successful ramp was made. The main feature that proved this mechanism’s challenge was consistency of singular release. In order to do this, we decided to use a solenoid that activates through a hole in the ramp. With this in mind, the shape of the ramp was formed.

The initial two ramp designs were the L and the long ramp, shown above in Figures 1 and 2. The L lined up the marbles vertically, and the solenoid was activated from the back side. The long ramp assembled the marbles in a shallower slope that flowed downwards to the right, with the solenoid still activating from the back. When tested, both designs proved to be wildly unpredictable. Gradually, the ramp became a channel that lines the marbles up in a slope that deposits them directly forward from the above channels, as shown below in Figure 3. This allowed for consolidation of space as well as a cleaner design.

The most important aspect of the final ramp design was the manipulation of the solenoid’s angled position. While the ramp itself proved to be a well-engineered device, it alone did not determine whether the marble release was consistent. If the angle of the solenoid was changed, all while using the same ramp, the mechanism could go from releasing one marble to five.  

At first, when we believed that the ramp alone would ensure consistency, the solenoids were attached with hot glue. While trying to determine whether the rest position of the solenoid would be extended or retracted, the solenoids would heat up and fall off if left retracted for too long. Thus, a holder was designed that angled the solenoids towards the front of the ramp, shown below in Figure 4, giving just enough length at full extension to push the marbles over the small hump.
