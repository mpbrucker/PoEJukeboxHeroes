## About Us
Jukebox Heroes is made up of five dedicated and excited students of a Principles of Engineering class at Olin College of Engineering. As a part of this class we were given 8 weeks to create a product that contained mechanical, electrical, and software components. With this prompt and timeline in mind we ideated potential project ideas ranging from braille printers to automated gardens, and settled upon the idea of making a mechanically played jukebox. From this Jukebox Heroes was born.

Kerry McConnaughay, originally from Northern Virginia, is a member of the Class of 2020 and intends to major in Mechanical Engineering. She is primarily interested in the intersection of mechanical engineering with the medical field and hopes to work on biomedical devices or go to medical school (still undecided). In her free time, she really enjoys music and plays in Olin's Conductorless Orchestra. She had a great time working on the jukebox and combining her engineering skills with music. She loved working with the other Jukebox Heroes and is glad they could move past their differences in their tastes of music.

Matt is a Class of 2020 E:Computing major. He grew up romping through the corn fields of Iowa, and as such he shares a special bond with anything corn-related. On the team, his primary focus is handling the software tasks and finding sketchy C++ libraries for various purposes. In this project, he hopes to get better at doing rapid prototyping through laser cutting and 3D printing, and to also learn more about a programming language that isn't Python. In his free time, he enjoys doing education research and singing along to "Mi Gente."
