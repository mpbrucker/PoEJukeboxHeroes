## Timeline

In order to produce our MVP and ensure we reasonably paced our progress, we broke down our project into different subsystems. For each sprint, we decided on end goals for subsystem components we wanted to have completed by the sprint review. The subsystems and corresponding tasks for each of the sprints are shown below:

| | **Ball Dropper** | **Ball Return** | **Button Functionality** | **Software Functionality** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Sprint 1 | 2 functioning chutes | N/A | N/A | Manually input notes |
| Sprint 2 | 6 functioning chutes | Ball conveyor system | N/A | RasPi integration |
| Sprint 3 (MVP) | 13 functioning chutes | Ball conveyor system | Buttons for song selection | Software fully integrated |
| Sprint 4 | 13 utilized chutes | Scraping mechanism & back railing | DONE | DONE
