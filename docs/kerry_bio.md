![Kerry McConnaughay, sophomore mechanical engineer.](media/kerry.jpg)

Kerry McConnaughay, originally from Northern Virginia, is a member of the Class of 2020 and intends to major in Mechanical Engineering. She is primarily interested in the intersection of mechanical engineering with the medical field and hopes to work on biomedical devices or go to medical school (still undecided). In her free time, she really enjoys music and plays in Olin's Conductorless Orchestra. She had a great time working on the jukebox and combining her engineering skills with music. She loved working with the other Jukebox Heroes and is glad they could move past their differences in their tastes of music.
